## Self-Sovereign Identity as a decentralized solution to the custody of private credentials.

This project focuses on developing a Proof of Concept (PoC) for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), wich is a digital identity model that allows individuals to own, control, and manage their identities independently without relying on centralized authorities. It provides a secure, privacy-enhanced identity framework that can be used across multiple contexts and areas. This repository is divided as it follows:

- `Deliverables/`
This folder contains all the final deliverables of the project including reports and presentations.

- `LaTeXDocs/`
This folder contains the LaTeX files used for writing the technical documents related to the project.

- `PoC_SSI/`
This folder contains the Proof of Concept (PoC) code developed for demonstrating the functionality of the SSI system.
